  # Create Storage Structure for Assignment Submissions

  1. Storage Organization
    - Create folder structure: submissions/{assignment_id}/{submission_id}/
    - Each assignment's submissions stored separately
    - Each individual submission has its own folder

  2. Security
    - Allow public access to view submission files
    - Allow anyone to upload submission files (no authentication required)
    - Allow anyone to delete submission files

  3. RLS Policies
    - Public read access for all submission files
    - Public upload access for submissions
    - Public delete access for submissions
*/

-- The storage bucket 'classroom-files' already exists, so we just need to ensure
-- the folder structure and policies are properly set up for submissions

-- Note: The existing policies from the previous migration already cover
-- submissions since they allow access to the entire 'classroom-files' bucket

-- We don't need additional SQL commands since the existing bucket and policies
-- already support the submissions folder structure we want to implement

-- Folder structure will be: classroom-files/submissions/{assignment_id}/{submission_id}/filename.ext
